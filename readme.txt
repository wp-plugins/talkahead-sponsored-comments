Earn more ad revenue fast! TalkAhead’s new turnkey advertising platform called Sponsored Comments. Free and easy to implement and manage.

== Description ==

Put an end to free advertising!

As a publisher, you want to allow your readers to voice their reactions to the articles you run. 
But you also know that not all comments are written by readers; they’re the handiwork of marketing executives or freelance writers hired to sway your audience. 
You can recognize biased comments, but your readers may not, and that, in turn, can jeopardize your objectivity.

At the same time, those marketing executives may be current or potential advertisers for you. 
Wouldn’t you like to offer them a better option, one that also allows you to open a new channel for revenue?
Now with TalkAhead you can.

This plugin facilitates the installation of TalkAhead sponsored comments on a WordPress driven web site.

= How It Works =
Advertisers create a short response to an article or blog post known as a Sponsored Comment.
